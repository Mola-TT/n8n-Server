# Remote SSH AI Instruction
This window is currently connected to a remote server.
I am developing the setup script of an n8n server with multiple features.
The current directory contains the scripts used to set up this server.

Important:
You may execute commands directly on the server to help with troubleshooting.
Do not modify the script directly on this server, because I will make the changes on my development machine. This is part of the development cycle.
Sometimes logs may appear empty or minimal. This is normal because I may perform fresh installations of the server to test the setup scripts.

Expected Output:
At the end, provide me with:
Clear errors or issues found.
Troubleshooting history (steps you took to investigate).
Solutions (what needs to be fixed).
The result should be in plain text, so that I can send it back to my AI helper on my development machine. The AI helper will then use it to fix and modify the script.

Your role in this chat:
Analyze the logs generated by the setup scripts.
Inspect any errors.
